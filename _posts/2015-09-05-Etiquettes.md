How about composing a series of articles in a blog or a website to explain coding and otherwise technical etiquettes. We can have things like:

* how to use npm
* how to manage python packages and version
* design etiquettes

Basically, all the things for which there are many bad ways to do. There is no single trusted place where I can go to learn all this.
